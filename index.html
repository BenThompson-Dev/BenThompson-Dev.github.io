									<span class="image right"><img src="images/profilepicture.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi! I'm Ben Thompson, a Staffordshire University Computer Games Design and Programming graduate with a first-class degree. I have experience in games programming as well as design, having taken a year-long placement role and gained industry experience using Unity and C# for both PC and console development, using C++ with DirectX and SDL, as well as the blueprint system in Unreal Engine during my studies. I have a keen passion for games and have taken part in multiple game jams and projects on top of my existing work.<br /><br />
									I also have a strong interest in composing and write music in my spare time, as well as incorporating it into my projects in various ways.<br /><br />
									Currently, I'm working on a couple of personal projects as well as touching up my existing work for my portfolio.

									<h2>Gameplay Programming</h2>
									<p>
										For my industry programming placement, I worked at <i>Double Eleven</i> on <i>Rust Console Edition</i>, working as a gameplay programmer throughout multiple major updates to the game in 2022-23.
										My focus was mostly on bug fixing different elements of the gameplay, making the game as close to the PC version as possible.
										I also assisted with the production of upcoming content to deliver more updates to the players, as well as optimising parts of the game to improve the game experience.
									</p>
									<p>During my time working on an industry project, I gained experience in development for consoles, as well as working on a large online multiplayer game and how the gameplay interacts with the network systems.</p>
									<p>Rust Console Edition is available to play on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

									<h2>Gameplay Programming, Audio Programming, Music</h2>
									<p>Disc-GO! is a local multiplayer party game developed as part of Staffordshire University's 6-week 1-Up Scheme internship. Using <i>Unreal Engine 5</i>'s blueprint system, I worked as one of the tech team developing the gameplay of the game.</p>
									<p>
										In my role on the game, I reformatted the gameplay loop from the basic prototype, and built on top of it to create the structure for the core gamemodes. I also focused on the power-up system, as well as handling bug fixes across various parts of the project.
									</p>
									<p>I also took the lead on the audio side, co-ordinating with the sound designer as well as using other assets that had been compiled. I implemented all the audio in-engine, including the dynamic music system for each level that I had designed, implemented and composed the music for.</p>
									<p>Disc-GO! has been nominated for Best Social Game at the <a href="https://tiga.org/awards/2024-shortlist"><i>TIGA Games Industry Awards 2024</i></a>.</p>

									<h2>Programming, Design, Concept, Music</h2>
									<p>Pulse Trigger is a top-down shooter rhythm game where the player has the complete the objective for each level, while also being able to upgrade their weapons over time to make them more powerful. It is a solo indie game project that I first started to work on in my university work, and then have kept working on since to flesh the game out more.</p>
									<p>
										The game is built in Unity using C#, and is the first time I had undertaken a larger-scoped project that was aiming to be at the polish level of a full game project.
										As part of the project, I designed the game, creating game and technical design documentation and focusing on proper project management to keep it on track.
									</p>
									<p>It is still a project I am working on the side, polishing up the gameplay by fixing bugs and also adding more content in the form of levels and music tracks to add more variety to the game. The current version of the game is available to <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/pulse-trigger">play now on itch.io.</a></p>

									<h1>ANTI-G</h1>
									<h2>F-Zero Track Procedural Generator / Dissertation</h2>
									<h2>Programming</h2>
									<p>
										Anti-G is a procedural
										<i>F-Zero </i>
										race track generator that was made for my final year Game Development Project, being used to support a dissertation for exploring criteria for believability in generating
										<i>F-Zero </i>
										race tracks. The project involved a recreation of
										<i>F-Zero X</i>
										's gameplay and the track generation system that has parameters exposed to the user. The tracks are generated through a procedural algorithm based on L-systems and Wave Function Collapse, which handles creating the spline used to generate the track mesh..
										Tracks can generate using cylinders and flat tracks, with extra sections for recharging and boosting the vehicle.
									</p>
									<p>
										Tracks can be saved, as well as the race data exported, which was used as the basis for the dissertation, which explored the effects changing some of the parameters of generation had on the tracks themselves. This was compared against the tracks in
										<i> F-Zero X</i>
										to highlight what changed the most, and how close to the original designs they were.
									</p>
									<p>The current version of the project is available to <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/anti-g">download now on itch.io.</a></p>

									<h2>GMTK Game Jam 2024</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/StarScalersKeyArt.jpg" alt="StarSCALERS" /></span>
									<h2>Gameplay Programming</h2>
									<p>
										In a small team of 2 programmers and 1 artist, over the course of only 48 hours, I helped to create a top-down shooter where the player has control of a ship that changes in size, which affects how much damage the player can do but also leaves them more vulnerable to damage.
										Built in Unity using C#, my main focus on the game was implementing the ship mechanics, as well as the overall gameplay loop and score system.
									</p>
									<p>The game can be downloaded through its <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/starscalers">itch.io page.</a></p>
