									<span class="image right"><img src="images/profilepicture.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi! I'm Ben Thompson, a Final Year Computer Games Design and Programming Student at Staffordshire University. I have experience in games programming as well as design, having taken a year-long placement role and gained industry experience using Unity and C# for both PC and console development, as well as the blueprint system in Unreal Engine 4 during my studies. I have a keen passion for games and have taken part in multiple game jams on top of my existing work.<br /><br />
									I also have a strong passion for composing, and write music in my spare time, as well as incorporating it into my projects in various ways.<br /><br />
									Currently, I'm working on my final year university modules: investigating procedural generating race tracks for my dissertation project, and creating a multiplayer network game prototype.

									<h2>Gameplay Programming</h2>
									<p>
										For my industry programming placement, I worked at <i>Double Eleven</i> on <i>Rust Console Edition</i>, working as a gameplay programmer throughout multiple major updates to the game in 2022-23.
										My focus was mostly on bug fixing different elements of the gameplay, making the game as close to the PC version as possible.
										I also assisted with the production of upcoming content to deliver more updates to the players, as well as optimising parts of the game to improve the game experience.
									</p>
									<p>During my time working on an industry project, I gained experience in development for consoles, as well as working on a large online multiplayer game and how the gameplay interacts with the network systems.</p>
									<p>Rust Console Edition is available to play on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

									<h2>Gameplay Programming, Technical Design, Music</h2>
									<p>Mote Valley is a game made as part of a larger group with multiple disciplines, in which I was one of the techs/programmers.</p>
									<p>
										In my role on the game, I oversaw the core gameplay systems of the world and inventory, as well as planning to make sure they could seamlessly interact with the creature system that were being developed by another team member.
										Also, with no final year students in the group, I took on shared responsibility as the Lead Tech with a teammate, which meant we oversaw the technical design of the project as well.

									<h2>Programming, Design, Concept, Music</h2>
									<p>Pulse Trigger is a top-down shooter rhythm game where the player has the complete the objective for each level, while also being able to upgrade their weapons over time to make them more powerful. It is a solo indie game project that I first started to work on in my university work, and then have kept working on since to flesh the game out more.</p>
									<p>
										The game is built in Unity using C#, and is the first time I had undertaken a larger-scoped project that was aiming to be at the polish level of a full game project.
										As part of the project, I designed the game, creating game and technical design documentation and focusing on proper project management to keep it on track.
									</p>
									<p>It is still a project I am working on the side, polishing up the gameplay by fixing bugs and also adding more content in the form of levels and music tracks to add more variety to the game. The current version of the game is available to <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/pulse-trigger">play now on itch.io.</a></p>

									<h2>Gameplay Programming, Game, Technical, Level & UX Design</h2>
									<p>As part of the first semester of the <i>Advanced 3D Games Engines and Scripting</i> module, I created a fish puzzle game using Unreal Engine 4's blueprint system. In the project, each fish has it's own ability and the player needs to swap between them to get through the challenges in the level.</p>
									<p>I worked on this project on my own, using royalty-free assets and designing the gameplay and technical aspect, as well as doing all the blueprint scripting, including implementing a system to easily manage character abilities. I also put time into polishing the experience, focusing on tweaking the design and adding features/UI elements to improve the user experience.</p>
									<p>The game prototype is available to <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/fish-shift">play now on itch.io.</a></p>

									<h1>SHIFTY 8s</h1>
									<h2>Major Jam 4: Cosmic</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Shifty8s.jpg" alt="Shifty 8s" /></span>
									<h2>Gameplay Programming, Music</h2>
									<p>In a team, I took part in <em>Major Jam 4: Cosmic</em> and helped work on a card game called Shifty 8s. With the limitation of the game jam being that the player had to cheat, we implemented a feature involving the player removing cards from their hand when the enemy AI isn't looking. The whole project took place over the span of a week, and was built in Unity using C#.</p>
									<p>The main role I took in the game jam team was programming the systems and gameplay mechanics, as well as implementing the AI logic so that it would interact with the game itself. I also assisted with the design of the cheating mechanic, as well as composing the music for the game.</p>
									<p>The game can be downloaded through its <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/shifty-8s">itch.io page.</a></p>
