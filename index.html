									<span class="image right"><img src="images/profilepicture.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi! I'm Ben Thompson, a final year Computer Games Design and Programming Student at Staffordshire University. I have experience in games programming as well as design, having taken a year-long placement role and gained industry experience using Unity and C# for both PC and console development, using C++ with DirectX and SDL, as well as the blueprint system in Unreal Engine during my studies. I have a keen passion for games and have taken part in multiple game jams on top of my existing work.<br /><br />
									I also have a strong interest in composing and write music in my spare time, as well as incorporating it into my projects in various ways.<br /><br />
									Currently, I'm working on the last of my university modules: a vertical slice of a larger game as a group project, and a recreation/modernisation of the arcade game
									<i>Sinistar </i>
									in C++ using SFML. I'm also continuing to further develop my final year project, an <i>F-Zero</i> procedural race track generator by polishing up the gameplay experience and adding in other drivers to race against.

									<h2>Gameplay Programming</h2>
									<p>
										For my industry programming placement, I worked at <i>Double Eleven</i> on <i>Rust Console Edition</i>, working as a gameplay programmer throughout multiple major updates to the game in 2022-23.
										My focus was mostly on bug fixing different elements of the gameplay, making the game as close to the PC version as possible.
										I also assisted with the production of upcoming content to deliver more updates to the players, as well as optimising parts of the game to improve the game experience.
									</p>
									<p>During my time working on an industry project, I gained experience in development for consoles, as well as working on a large online multiplayer game and how the gameplay interacts with the network systems.</p>
									<p>Rust Console Edition is available to play on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

									<h2>Gameplay Programming, Technical Design, Music</h2>
									<p>Mote Valley is a game made as part of a larger group with multiple disciplines, in which I was one of the techs/programmers.</p>
									<p>
										In my role on the game, I oversaw the core gameplay systems of the world and inventory, as well as planning to make sure they could seamlessly interact with the creature system that were being developed by another team member.
										Also, with no final year students in the group, I took on shared responsibility as the Lead Tech with a teammate, which meant we oversaw the technical design of the project as well.
									</p>
									<p>The game project is available to <a href="https://jakeslevels.itch.io/mote-valley">play now on itch.io.</a></p>

									<h2>Programming, Design, Concept, Music</h2>
									<p>Pulse Trigger is a top-down shooter rhythm game where the player has the complete the objective for each level, while also being able to upgrade their weapons over time to make them more powerful. It is a solo indie game project that I first started to work on in my university work, and then have kept working on since to flesh the game out more.</p>
									<p>
										The game is built in Unity using C#, and is the first time I had undertaken a larger-scoped project that was aiming to be at the polish level of a full game project.
										As part of the project, I designed the game, creating game and technical design documentation and focusing on proper project management to keep it on track.
									</p>
									<p>It is still a project I am working on the side, polishing up the gameplay by fixing bugs and also adding more content in the form of levels and music tracks to add more variety to the game. The current version of the game is available to <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/pulse-trigger">play now on itch.io.</a></p>

									<h2>F-Zero Track Procedural Generator / Dissertation</h2>

									<h2>Programming</h2>
									<p>
										Anti-G is a procedural 
										<i>F-Zero </i>
										race track generator that was made for my final year Game Development Project, being used to support a dissertation for exploring criteria for believability in generating 
										<i>F-Zero </i>
										race tracks. The project involved a recreation of
										<i>F-Zero X</i>
										's gameplay and the track generation system that has parameters exposed to the user. The tracks are generated through a procedural algorithm based on L-systems and Wave Function Collapse, which handles creating the spline used to generate the track mesh..
										Tracks can generate using cylinders and flat tracks, with extra sections for recharging and boosting the vehicle.
									</p>
									<p>Tracks can be saved, as well as the race data exported, which was used as the basis for the dissertation, which explored the effects changing some of the parameters of generation had on the tracks themselves. This was compared against the tracks in 
									<i> F-Zero X</i>
										to highlight what changed the most, and how close to the original designs they were.</p>
									<p>The project is currently still being worked on, adding improvements and polish to the generation and user experience, as well as implementing computer-controlled racers to play against.</p>

									<h2>Major Jam 4: Cosmic</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Shifty8s.jpg" alt="Shifty 8s" /></span>
									<h2>Gameplay Programming, Music</h2>
									<p>In a team, I took part in <em>Major Jam 4: Cosmic</em> and helped work on a card game called Shifty 8s. With the limitation of the game jam being that the player had to cheat, we implemented a feature involving the player removing cards from their hand when the enemy AI isn't looking. The whole project took place over the span of a week, and was built in Unity using C#.</p>
									<p>The main role I took in the game jam team was programming the systems and gameplay mechanics, as well as implementing the AI logic so that it would interact with the game itself. I also assisted with the design of the cheating mechanic, as well as composing the music for the game.</p>
									<p>The game can be downloaded through its <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/shifty-8s">itch.io page.</a></p>
