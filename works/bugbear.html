					<h1>RISE OF THE BUGBEAR DESIGN DOCUMENTATION</h1>
					<p>Rise of the Bugbear is a tower-defense Unreal Engine 4 framework in which robots spawn and move along a set path, while the towers shoot at them and try to defeat them. Using the framework, I had design a level, and create the stats for the towers and enemies.</p>
					<p>The design documentation below is a formatted, revised version of the work I submitted as part of the second semester of the module.</p>

					<h2>Basic Stats</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="itgd/Sem2/Week6_InitialTowerStats.jpg" alt="Initial Tower Stats" /></span>
						After running the framework for the first time, I came up with some basic ideas on how I would want each tower to play. Thinking about how the different types of tower would be perceived by players, I wanted the cannon to do lots of damage but fire at longer intervals, the magic to focus on armour penetration, and the machine to fire quickly but not be able to pierce through armour.
						<br /><br />
						<span class="image right"><img src="itgd/Sem2/Week6_InitialTowerStats2.jpg" alt="Altered Tower Stats" /></span>
						After a playtest, I found that the values were too low as the game didn’t get completed before I lost all my lives, so I changed the values and lowered them to try and get a more ‘balanced’ feel to the framework’s progression.
						<br /><br />
						<span class="image left"><img src="itgd/Sem2/Week6_GameOver.jpg" alt="Game Over" /></span>
						I spent some time altering the stats to try and have the game be completable, as in its current state the player was running out of lives before all the waves had been defeated.
						<br /><br />
						<span class="image right"><img src="itgd/Sem2/Week6_InitialTowerStats3.jpg" alt="Altered Tower Stats 2" /></span>
						While trying to balance the stats, I had moved too far into the other direction and made the game too ‘easy’ to complete. I particularly focused on the basic tower, as it felt way too powerful in its current form, easily getting the most kills out of all the towers. I also wanted to buff the cannon tower and magic towers, as I felt they were the least effective of the towers.
						<br /><br />

						After now getting through the framework with all 25 lives, I wanted to do a little bit more balancing of the towers before decreasing all the values to make the game ‘harder’.
