					<h1>SOLUS GALAXIA: THE HIDDEN PLANET ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK</h1>
					<h2>OST Composing Jam #3</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/SolusGalaxiaHiddenPlanet.jpg" alt="SOLUS GALAXIA: The Hidden Planet Original Soundtrack" /></span>
					<p>For <em><a href="https://itch.io/jam/ost-composing-jam-3">OST Composing Jam #3</a></em>, the theme was Story of Seasons. After some brainstorming, I came up with the idea to create a soundtrack for a fictional expansion to the game idea I made in the last OST Composing Jam.</p>
					<p>For this jam, I didn't have as much time as OST Composing Jam #2, but managed to create five tracks (a main theme and one for each season), totalling to around 12 minutes of music. Once again, I made a cohesive sound by reusing some motifs from the first soundtrack, and also creating a new main theme that some of the seasonal tracks draw inspiration from. I tried to branch out a bit more while staying true to the last soundtrack, with each track being themed around each season it let me use different sound textures and techniques, as well as using it as an excuse to experiment with new virtual instruments and sounds.</p>
					<p>The soundtrack is available to download on its <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/solus-galaxia-the-hidden-planet-original-soundtrack">itch.io page</a>, and and available to stream on SoundCloud.</a></p>

					<h2>OST Composing Jam: PASTIME I</h2>

					<h2>Top 5</h2>
					<p><em><a href="https://itch.io/jam/ost-composing-jam-pastime-1">OST Composing Jam: PASTIME I</a></em> was focused around making a cover or tribute to already existing video game tracks instead of writing original music; because the theme was New Beginnings, I decided to work on tracks from the start of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (the timing of the remakes coming out the week after made it especially fitting). I ultimately settled on making a medley of two tracks, originally I wanted to make multiple separate tracks but I ran out of time trying to balance working on this project alongside other work.</p>
					<p>I tried to stay very faithful to the original tracks, working on the arrangement from a lens of updating and modernising the DS sounds while also building upon the foundations of the originals. I composed the track in an orchestral style, with some sparsely used synth sounds to emphasise certain elements in the music.</p>
					<p>The track (and its revised album mix) are available to listen to on its <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/title-screen-introduction-from-pokmon-diamond-and-pearl">itch.io page</a> and are also available to stream on SoundCloud. The revised version is also available as part of the album release, which is on all major platforms.</p>

					<h1>SOLUS GALAXIA ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK</h1>
					<h2>OST Composing Jam #2</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/SolusGalaxia.jpg" alt="SOLUS GALAXIA Original Soundtrack" /></span>
					<h2>4th Place</h2>
					<p>For <em><a href="https://itch.io/jam/ost-composing-jam-2">OST Composing Jam #2</a></em>, the theme was Panspermia (the hypothesis that live exists throughout the universe), so I quickly came up with the idea of writing a soundtrack for a game where you travel through space alone, trying to discover new life. This created a basis for the style I would go for, writing in a style that fused orchestral and synth sounds to invoke the atmosphere of space.</p>
					<p>Throughout the jam's duration, I managed to compose 7 tracks, which totalled up to around 20 minutes of music. To make it sound like the soundtrack sound much more cohesive despite some of the tracks contrasting each other in style, I wrote the main theme first, and reused the melodies as motifs throughout the different tracks. After the jam's rating period had ended, I came 4th overall; this soundtrack has also become my favourite composition project that I've ever done.</p>
					<p>The soundtrack (and the revised album mixes of some tracks) are available to listen to on its <a href="https://ben-thompson.itch.io/solus-galaxia">itch.io page</a> and are also available to stream on SoundCloud. The revised mixes of some of the tracks are also available as part of the <a href="https://smarturl.it/OSTCompJam2">album release, which is on all major platforms.</a></p>
